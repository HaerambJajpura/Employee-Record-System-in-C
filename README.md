# This is an employee record system in C langauge.

How to run the program

1. delete all the files in folder except "emprec.c" and "README.md".
2. open "emprec.c", come to the main() function and comment out the while loop and uncomment the initialise() function.
3. enter the starting ID in the brackets of initializing function. It will be the first ID alotted then it will just add 1 to the next id
4. compile the program and run it. The program will create a file called "idallot.txt" which stores the data related to the current ID.
5. now go to main() function and comment out initialize() function and uncomment the whole while loop.
6. now again compile the code and start running it. while you run the program it will created some files like "empdata.txt", "tempdata.txt" and "exported.txt". Do not delete these files
